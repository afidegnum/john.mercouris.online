The first in my series of Nonstop House mixes meant for studying and
deep relaxation. The goal is to provide music in one hour blocks that
can be used as a study, relaxation, or focus aid.Â  While it is also
meant as a tool for user's to study with, efforts are also made to
provide attribution to the original music creators.
