I've been trying to learn German for quite some time. It has been a
little bit over a year now that I've been learning German. I've used
numerous pieces of software and techniques, so I would like to share
some of my learnings in a condensed format so that someone wishing to
learn a language may garner some useful tips from my experience.

1. Rosetta Stone

   </div>

.. raw:: html

   <div>

This is useful for hearing the language and trying to understand what is
being said. It helps build useful phrases into your  vocabulary, this is
the first phase and helps jump start your learning. It isn't really good
for any actual learning, but if you want to get the basic gist of
something before a vacation, this is a good tool.

2. Duolingo

.. raw:: html

   </div>

.. raw:: html

   <div>

This is useful for practicing your grammar and conjugation. This program
tests you on your ability to conjugate things and to  remember
vocabulary. This application is also available for free on the web, your
iPhone, or your Android. I would recommend this is a go-to resource for
someone serious about learning a language. This is a great basis and
jump off point, currently Duolingo supports four languages, but you can
check their website as they are constantly adding new ones.

3. Anki

   <div>

This is a universal flash card application. You can find flash cards for
just about anything. The program will test you on your flash card 
knowledge and review cards that you have difficulty with. You can also
create your own flash cards and decks of flash card. This is  a great
program for building your vocabulary after you've grounded and built up
a good base of grammar.

4. Watch  Media in the Language of Choice

This is real world practice of hearing native speakers talk and
formulate sentences. This can be difficult at first, but it may be
useful to even watch with subtitles to increase your exposure to the
language. It also helps to have a buddy who can help you out and
practice simple conversations with you.

do them in the order of
