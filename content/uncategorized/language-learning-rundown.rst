I've been trying to learn German for quite some time. It has been a
little bit over a year now that I've been learning German. I've used
numerous pieces of software and techniques, so I would like to share
some of my learnings in a condensed format so that someone wishing to
learn a language may garner some useful tips from my experience. 

1. Rosetta Stone
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is useful for hearing the language and trying to understand what is
being said. It helps build useful phrases into your  vocabulary, this is
the first phase and helps jump start your learning. It isn't really good
for any actual learning, but if you want to get the basic gist of
something before a vacation, this is a good tool.

2. Duolingo
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is useful for practicing your grammar and conjugation. This program
tests you on your ability to conjugate things and to  remember
vocabulary. This application is also available for free on the web, your
iPhone, or your Android. I would recommend this is a go-to resource for
someone serious about learning a language. This is a great basis and
jump off point, currently Duolingo supports four languages, but you can
check their website as they are constantly adding new ones.

|Duolingo Browser|

You can browse all the lessons, see your progress and
check out which skills you need to refresh.

|Duolingo Lesson Topics|

The Lessons contain very
concise topics and a clear focus so that you can work on what you need
to without wasting time.

|Lesson Example|

Typical lessons include translating back and forth between different languages
and dragging words in common order. If you enable microphone, there are
also pronunciation tests; but you can disable this if you
like.

3. Anki
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a universal flash card application. You can find flash cards for
just about anything. The program will test you on your flash card 
knowledge and review cards that you have difficulty with. You can also
create your own flash cards and decks of flash card. This is  a great
program for building your vocabulary after you've grounded and built up
a good base of grammar.

|Deck View|

View your current decks, how many cards you have to review or learn.

|Flash Card|

A typical flash card includes the word, and then a translation which
you press to reveal, rate yourself on how easy it was for you to get
the card and it will change the duration and frequency with which it
will appear in your reviews. Cards may also include audio and other
media.

|Statistics|

In addition to providing targeted feedback for review and
organizing your cards for you; Anki has a sophisticated forecasting and
prediction tool that shows numerous graphs and plots about your current
and future progress.

|Card Browser|

Anki also has a great browser and editor for managing all of your flash
cards.

4. Watch  Media in the Language of Choice
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is real world practice of hearing native speakers talk and
formulate sentences. This can be difficult at first, but it may be
useful to even watch with subtitles to increase your exposure to the
language. It also helps to have a buddy who can help you out and
practice simple conversations with you.

**Short Version**

#. Rosetta stone practice quick start / Vacation gist
#. Duolingo conjugation/ grammar
#. Anki Vocabulary build up
#. TV / News / Radio for real world practice in comprehension and speaking

Consistency is key. Easy goal of 15 minutes a day, before sleep (for
good retention),

Best of luck!
