The Idea
========

A cubic world is a short little project I did involving perspective and
photography. I took two photos during the sunset at the Brandenburger
Tor at an offset from the center line of the road. Then by flipping one
source image and adding a drop shadow, I was able to simulate a
cube/drop off of the world for a rather interesting image.

 

The Source Images
=================

Here are the source images:

|IMG_3588|

and

|IMG_3589|

The Result
==========

Together with some basic image manipulation you can create an entirely
new world:

|WorldACube|

 

Thanks for Reading!
