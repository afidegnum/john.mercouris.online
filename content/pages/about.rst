Hi, my name is John Mercouris. I'm a Computer Scientist with a passion
for developing high quality human interfaces. The projects and
research I work on center around the idea that we can make
interactions with our programs beautiful, and logically beautiful.

By empirically analyzing, understanding, and abstracting the
constraints of our machines and applications, we can create deep
clarity in interface and functionality.

If you would like to contact me, the best way to reach me is by
email. My email address is john + (@ symbol) + mercouris + .email
