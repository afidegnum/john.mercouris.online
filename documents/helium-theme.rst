In an effort to make a cleaner website, I've developed a fork of the
popular oxygen theme:

http://alienwp.com/themes/oxygen/

 

That is the theme (as of the time of this writing) on this blog.

 

I've made a few changes, such as making it full width/expandable, and
adding support for a different layout for an archive of posts. The code
can be found at:
